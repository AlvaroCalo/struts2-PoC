# Struts2 Web Application

This is a basic web application made in Struts2. It includes some basic web rendering, CRUDs to a MariaDB database and basic JQuery tables.

## Technologies

For the Front-End I've used:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap template

For the Back-End I've used:
1. Java with Struts2 framework
2. MariaDB

## How to test it

You have to create a database called surfdonostia and import the file surfdonostia.sql.
In the Conexion.java class, inside com.web.modelos, you have to write the user and the password of the database.

Thank you
